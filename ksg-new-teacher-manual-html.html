    <h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction to KSG</h2>
    <p>KSG (Kids Small Group) is a program designed to teach children about God, Jesus, and Christian principles. As a teacher, your role is crucial in shaping the spiritual growth of these young minds.</p>

    <h3>Your Role as a KSG Teacher</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Be a positive role model</li>
        <li>Create a welcoming and safe environment</li>
        <li>Teach biblical principles in an engaging way</li>
        <li>Foster a love for learning about God</li>
        <li>Collaborate with co-leaders and parents</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Remember, you're not just teaching lessons; you're helping shape young lives and their relationship with God.</p>

    <h2 id="setup">2. Classroom Setup and Management</h2>
    <h3>Room Setup: Step-by-Step Guide</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Arrive early (at least 15-20 minutes before class starts)</li>
        <li>Arrange seating in a way that promotes interaction (e.g., circle or small groups)</li>
        <li>Set up activity stations if applicable</li>
        <li>Prepare materials for the day's lesson</li>
        <li>Create a visible schedule of activities (more on this below)</li>
        <li>Set up a prayer request area</li>
        <li>Ensure the room is clean and welcoming</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Creating and Using a Visual Schedule</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Use a whiteboard or large poster board</li>
        <li>List activities in order (e.g., Welcome, Opening Prayer, Lesson, Activity, Snack, Closing)</li>
        <li>Include approximate times for each activity</li>
        <li>Use pictures or symbols for younger children</li>
        <li>Review the schedule at the beginning of class</li>
        <li>Reference the schedule during transitions</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Managing Transitions: A Process</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Give a 5-minute warning before the end of an activity</li>
        <li>Use a countdown technique (e.g., "We're switching activities in 5...4...3...2...1")</li>
        <li>Use a consistent signal (e.g., clapping pattern, special sound)</li>
        <li>Clearly state the next activity</li>
        <li>Have materials for the next activity ready</li>
        <li>Praise students who transition quickly and quietly</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="story">
        <h4>Story: The Importance of Schedules</h4>
        <p>Natasha shared a story about a child who was sitting just outside the circle. The leaders viewed it as non-compliance, but it was likely a coping mechanism for the child's anxiety. Having a visible schedule can help such children feel more secure, knowing what's coming next.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="engaging">3. Engaging Students</h2>

                        <li>E (Experiences): Gesture broadly</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

                <li>Show an interesting object related to the lesson</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Break up the lesson into shorter segments</li>
